Second year assignment for Object Oriented Systems &amp; Development. Point of the assignment was to implement a Client/Server system in C++ which could just receive basic input from the client and display it on the system.

The Server source can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/ZackehSoul/5126145), however I included the `server.exe` binary in the `resources\` directory. The code just needs building in a new project with the `ws2_32` library included.
